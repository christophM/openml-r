OpenML aims to create a frictionless, collaborative environment for exploring machine learning. This R package allows to interface the [OpenML](http://www.openml.org/frontend/page/home) server to download datasets, tasks, runs and upload results (see  [Tutorial](http://openml.github.io/openml-r)).

# How to cite

To cite the OpenML R package in publications, please use our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01293).

# Installation of the package

- Install the stable version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenML/index.html)
```r
install.packages("OpenML")
```
or

- Install the development version from GitHub (using `devtools`)
```r
devtools::install_github("openml/openml-r")
```

Furthermore, you need [farff](https://github.com/mlr-org/farff) installed to process [ARFF](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/arff.html) files:
```r
install.packages("farff")
```
Alternatively you can make use of the [RWeka](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RWeka/index.html) R package to process ARFF files. However, in particular for larger ARFF files, [farff](https://github.com/mlr-org/farff) is considerably faster than RWeka.

# Contact

Found some nasty bugs? Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/openml/openml-r/issues) to report on bugs or missing features. Pay attention to explain the problem as good as possible (in the best case with a `traceback()` result and a `sessionInfo()`). Moreover, a reproducible example is desirable.
